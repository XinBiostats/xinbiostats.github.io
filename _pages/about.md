Welcome to my website! I'm Xin Ma, a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://biostat.ufl.edu) at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu), where I'm fortunate to be guided by [Dr. Li Chen](https://biostat.ufl.edu/profile/chen-li-1/) and [Dr. Ramon C Sun](https://biochem.med.ufl.edu/profile/sun-ramon/). Prior to embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I earned a Master of Science in Statistics from George Washington University with 2-year Dean's Fellowship and completed my Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science at the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, China.

My research interests revolve around leveraging statistical learning and deep learning methods to explore various domains within biostatistics. This includes spatial multi-omics (Spatial Transcriptomic and Spatial Metabolomics), genomics (Single-cell sequence data), genetics (GWAS), and (bio)medical images (MALDI, Histology Image). By employing advanced computational techniques, I aim to uncover insights into complex biological systems, ultimately contributing to advancements in healthcare and biomedical research.
